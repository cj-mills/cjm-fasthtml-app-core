    Register multiple APIRouter instances to a FastHTML app at once.
    
    This is a convenience function that replaces multiple `.to_app(app)` calls
    with a single function call.
    
    Example:
        ```python
        from fasthtml.common import *
        from cjm_fasthtml_app_core.core.routing import register_routes
        
        # Create routers
        main_ar = APIRouter(prefix="/")
        settings_ar = APIRouter(prefix="/settings")
        api_ar = APIRouter(prefix="/api")
        
        # Instead of:
        # main_ar.to_app(app)
        # settings_ar.to_app(app)
        # api_ar.to_app(app)
        
        # Do this:
        register_routes(app, main_ar, settings_ar, api_ar)
        ```

        router.to_app(app)
