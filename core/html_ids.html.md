``` python

def AppHtmlIds(
    args:VAR_POSITIONAL, kwargs:VAR_KEYWORD
):

```

*Base HTML ID constants for FastHTML applications.*

This class provides centralized HTML ID constants that are commonly used
across FastHTML applications. All IDs are defined as class attributes
for IDE autocomplete and type checking.

**For IDE Support:**

IDEs like VS Code with Pylance will autocomplete these attributes and
warn if you try to access non-existent attributes. To add app-specific
IDs, extend this class:

``` python
class MyAppHtmlIds(AppHtmlIds):
    CUSTOM_SECTION = "custom-section"
    SIDEBAR = "sidebar"
```

**Note:** The `typing.Final` annotation indicates these are constants
that shouldn’t be reassigned at runtime.

``` python
# Example usage
print(f"Main content ID: {AppHtmlIds.MAIN_CONTENT}")
print(f"As selector: {AppHtmlIds.as_selector(AppHtmlIds.MAIN_CONTENT)}")
```

    Main content ID: main-content
    As selector: #main-content

``` python
# Example: Extending AppHtmlIds for app-specific IDs
class MyAppHtmlIds(AppHtmlIds):
    """Extended HTML IDs for my application."""
    SIDEBAR = "sidebar"
    FOOTER = "footer"
    NAVBAR = "navbar"

# IDE will autocomplete these and warn about typos
print(f"Sidebar ID: {MyAppHtmlIds.SIDEBAR}")
print(f"As selector: {MyAppHtmlIds.as_selector(MyAppHtmlIds.SIDEBAR)}")
print(f"Main content still available: {MyAppHtmlIds.MAIN_CONTENT}")

# This would cause an IDE warning (if you uncomment it):
# print(MyAppHtmlIds.NONEXISTENT)  # ← IDE shows: "NONEXISTENT" is not a known attribute
```

    Sidebar ID: sidebar
    As selector: #sidebar
    Main content still available: main-content
